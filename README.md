# LASER-SECURITY-SYSTEM-USING-ARDUINO
In this project, I have designed Laser Light Security System Using Arduino with Alarm with the application of Laser Diode Module KY-008. The project idea revolves around creating a security system. Whenever any object will obstruct the LASER ray the buzzer alarm will start ringing.
