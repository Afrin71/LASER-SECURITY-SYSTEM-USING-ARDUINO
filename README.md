# LASER-SECURITY-SYSTEM-USING-ARDUINO
In this project, I have designed Laser Light Security System Using Arduino with Alarm with the application of Laser Diode Module KY-008. The project idea revolves around creating a security system. Whenever any object will obstruct the LASER ray the buzzer alarm will start ringing.

This project can be implemented anywhere, not only buildings or premises but many precious things like jewelry, diamonds, precious antique items in the museum, etc many other things are also secured. Many people secure their home, office, shops, warehouses, etc with the LASER beam security system.
